# NewsSense — *Why Is My Fund Down?*

**NewsSense** is an intelligent, news-based explanation engine that helps users understand why a particular stock or mutual fund is rising or falling — by analyzing **real-time news scraped directly from the web**, with **zero reliance on scraper APIs or news APIs**.

Built with a powerful **LangChain pipeline**, NewsSense tracks indirect relationships between mutual fund holdings and the latest financial events to generate smart, relevant answers.

## How It Works

1. **User Query** — e.g., _"Why is ARKK falling today?"_
2. **Ticker Extraction** — Groq identifies the relevant ticker (`ARKK`).
3. **Fund Holdings Lookup** — If it’s a mutual fund/ETF, we fetch its top holdings.
4. **News Scraping** — Recent articles from the web are scraped and parsed.
5. **Embedding + Search** — Articles are embedded and stored in **FAISS**. A similarity search retrieves the most relevant ones based on fund/company data.
6. **LLM Explanation** — The retrieved context is passed to an LLM to generate a concise explanation.

## Example

> **Query**:  
> _"Why did QQQ drop this week?"_

> **NewsSense**:  
> _"QQQ, which holds major tech stocks like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, saw a decline largely due to a recent drop in Big Tech earnings and a hawkish Fed statement signaling rate hikes. The market reacted negatively to this macroeconomic signal."_
